# Cal Day's Website

The primary directive of this project is to set up both a public and private UI for various web-based activities such as:  
    - telling people about myself  
    - sharing my thoughts on various topics  
    - organizing, archiving, and sharing my projects  
    - sharing and archiving simple lessons I have learned over the years
    - my calendar and todo-items and sharing some of that information publicly  
    - my self-hosted git repos and sharing some of that information publicly  
    - telling people the best ways of contacting me
