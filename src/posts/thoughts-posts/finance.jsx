The first is ineptitude, living from paycheck to paycheck, hating tax season because you have to feel that uncomfortable feeling of diggin through a heap you piled onto each day of the year. Level 2 is the 'savy investor'. You begin to understand the time value of money and how inflation is always riding you so you begin to search for those 5% - 20% (maybe) anual returns on your money. Level three is where it gets interesting."
