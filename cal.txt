A being is any set of abilities and desires that procure desired results for the set. A stone has the ability to not fall apart, 
and has the desire to not fall apart (because if it does it is not a stone anymore, or at least not the stone it was before).
The sand the stone will fall apart into each has their own arrays of abilities and desires. 

A being that desires more than what they have the ability to achieve are goal oriented beings.




What am I?
How do I contend with my 'self', my 'goals', my 'wonderings'?

Aspects of me:
	<> brain
	<> body
	<> tools
	<> understanding / wisdom
	<> ability (to access information)
	<> ability (to solve problems and complete tasks)
